# Important note

TODO:
 - [X] Use last 2 minutes (eye closed) or at least compare with whole series.
 - [X] Separate columns AF3 - T8 from the quality control data.
 - [X] Switch to connectivity matrices.
 - [] Check if HPC support would be needed
 - [X] Exclude bad metadata (bad data could be also maked with specific values inside quality controll data)

**Important**
I removed the Guinea metadata related to the session, where the remarks indicated that something went wrong. The original dataset is located in the **original data** directory
